### Description
This is a graduate level introductory course to natural language processing (NLP). The
course is intended to develop foundations in NLP and text mining. The broader goal is to
understand how NLP tasks are carried out in the real world (e.g., Web) and how to build
tools for solving practical language processing problems. Throughout the course, large
emphasis will be placed on tying NLP techniques to specific real-world applications
through hands-on experience. The course is standalone and covers required topics of
machine learning and mathematical foundations. 

### Prerequisites
1. Algorithms and Data Structure (COSC 3320) or equivalent.
2. Sufficient programming experience (in C++/Java/Python, etc.) for building projects.
